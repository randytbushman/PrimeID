# PrimeFactorizer
Concurrent Programming class.

The PrimeFactorizer is a tool used to calculate the primes in a given interval. All prime numbers shall be stored in a list, while all composite numbers shall be stored in a map.

This program comes equipped with 4 modes:

    1.) Single Threaded
    2.) Multi Threaded (Unbounded)
    3.) Multi Threaded (Bounded Threadpool)
    4.) Multi Threaded (Bounded Threadpool Callable)
    
The computation time is returned as output each time the user selects a mode. To show correctness or to debug, the user enter the Factorizer classes and uncomment the print statements inside to show the contents of the collections.
