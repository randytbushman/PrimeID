# PrimeFactorizer
Concurrent Programming class.

The PrimeFactorizer is a tool used to calculate the primes in a given interval. All prime numbers shall be stored in a list, while all composite numbers shall be stored in a map.

This program comes equipped with 4 modes:

    1.) Single Threaded
    2.) Multi Threaded (Unbounded)
    3.) Multi Threaded (Bounded Threadpool)
    4.) Multi Threaded (Bounded Threadpool Callable)
    
The computation time is returned as output each time the user selects a mode. To show correctness or to debug, the user enter the Factorizer classes and uncomment the print statements inside to show the contents of the collections.

Feel free to check out the primesieve code as well! It is not part of the official project as it produced slower results than my previous solution. Documentation in that class is limited as it is not part of the official program.

Please note that while sources with code were used to create this program, the implementation is done entirely by me and my own design and tradecraft. I used only the numerical theorems and definitions, not the code for reference.
